---->> Day - 21 <<----
Today i made hte javascript to-do list.
I used javascript localStorage to store the data.
I refercend from code with harry javascript tutorial.
This project constains many complex js functions like  -- splice
      -- setItem
      -- itemsJson
      above functions i get refercend as i have to learn more about them.
But this is very interesting and challenging project for me as javascript beginner.
Special thanks to code with harry for giving me good understandig about js.
