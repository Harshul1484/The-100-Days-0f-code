---->> Day - 19 <<----
Today i did the sql TCl commands.
There only three commands like - COMMIT
                               - SAVEPOINT
                               - ROLLBACK
They are only for controlling the flow of the stored data.
And to make all  the changes parment And
dicard all  the panding transactions.
