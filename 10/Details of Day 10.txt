---->> Day - 10 <<----
Today i make to-do list using the python Gui.
I use tkinter modual for the add and delecting tasks.
Here tk.END represents the next position after the value enter by the user.
The curselection means the value which is selected by the user in the Listbox.
Entry widget is for taking the user input.
-- task_var.set("") -- >> This method is used to get value appropiatly like only in this example
only string var values are permited but when you enter the number values it will explictly convert
it into string using "" marks and None values are not permited.
