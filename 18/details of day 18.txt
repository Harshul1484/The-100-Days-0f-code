Today i did the sql joins.
Which is devided into two types - oracle joins
                                - sql joins
They both are almost similar effect but the only difference is their implementation.
There are many types of joins.

The type of oracle joins are - Equijoin
                             - Nonequijoin
                             - Outer join
                             - Self join

The types of sql joins are - Cross joins
                           - Natural joins
                           - Using clause
                           - Full or two sided outer
                             joins
                           - Arbitrary join conditions
                             for outer joins
