---->> Day - 13 Today <<----
Today i did the sql single row functions performing some queries.
I mainly used the functions like - case manipulation
                                 - character-manipulation
                                 - numeber functions
                                 - Date functions
                                 - Nesting functions
                                 - nullif
                                 - coalesec
                                 - case expression
                                 - decode function
These queries are very easy and i have very much fun in learning.
