---->> Day - 23 <<----
Today i made the zoomin gimage effect using javascript.
This effect is used in many websites like commerce and mapping websites.
I used javascript to add the zoomin effect to the images.
It simpley just making the width and height of the image big when mouse is over a image.
and resize it when the mouse is out of the image.
