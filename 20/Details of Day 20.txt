---->> Day - 20 <<----
Today i did my first javascipt project.
This is a simple digital clock with date.
I used javascipt date and toLocalDatestring function to get the real time & date.
Here i used three variables which are updated every seconds using the setinterval function.
The only difficulty i faced was combing the toLocalDatestring function and making const variable.
I really enjoyed making this project.
