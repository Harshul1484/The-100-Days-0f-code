---->> Day - 24 <<----
Today i bulid simple Registration form using html,css and javascript.
I mainly used the javascript for user interactions and field filling.
When one of thme field was not field then it's border will become red and others
become gray.
It uses the simple principal of checking the value is filled or not.
If filled then check next else give the alert with user interactions.
