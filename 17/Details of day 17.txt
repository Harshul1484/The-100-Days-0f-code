---->> Day - 17 <<----
Today i did the sql subqueries.
There are mainly two types of the subqueries like - single row subquery
                                                  - Multi row subquery
They are mainly used for fetching result using the another value which is not directly
avaliable.
Here if single row query it only allows single row operator.
and if multi row query so it allows only multi row operatoers.
